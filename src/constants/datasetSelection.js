  message: `Refers to the percentage of data being used to train and teach the model 
    the hidden features or patterns in the data.

  title: "Normalization",
  message: `The process of transforming or changing the columns in a dataset to a common
    scale is referred to as Normalization.
    Example: In the process known as Min-Max scaling, values are rescaled to ensure that the 
    values are within a specified range varying between 0 and 1. The process of scaling these 
    values on a common scale is known as normalization.`,

  title: "Binary Classification",
  message: `A type of classification that predicts categorical variables and categorizes
    the output into two classes. This is especially important when predicting a possible outcome
     based on a series of data given.
     Example: A patient displaying multiple symptoms for a particular disease is predicted to be 
     ‘healthy’ or ‘carrying the disease’ based on the two possible outcomes of their diagnosis. 
     This outcome is categorized into two classes known as positive and negative. `,

  message: `The term ‘multivariate’ refers to having one or more variables. It is the process
