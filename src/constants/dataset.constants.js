  of data scientists and machine learning practitioners, we are using a wide range of property sales records
  in an unknown format with unknown data quality issues in order to clean the data and use it to make

  description: ` The Iris prediction begins with the importing of preloaded datasets in order to gain 
  information on the features and statistics of the Iris species. The data is then categorized into a 
  dictionary which is then placed into data frames for ease of use and visibility. With the data being 
  categorized into four features which are the length and width of both the sepals and petals of the Iris,
  we are better able to understand the data presented. This step allows us to see the features and class 
  determination of the flowers together so that we can begin to clean our data and analyze the 
  relationships between features and target variables. As such, having cleaned and explored the data, 
  we are better able to make accurate predictions on the Iris dataset.`,
